    CLI tool to search torrents. Results are sorted by number of seeders and
    each is mapped to key. Pressing the key with assigned letter will open
    magnet link in your default client. On iOS, magnet link is placed into
    clipboard.

    switch to TPB.

              "trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN -P"

    _

    On Linux, start it without any parameter and it'll use clipboard content
    as keywords. ( needs 'xclip' or 'xsel' to be installed )

              "trrr"

    _

    Limit results which have at least 100 seeders.

              "trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN -100"

    _

    To get another torrent from previous search add key as parameter. This
    is mandatory on Windows running 'Git/Bash for Windows' where you have to
    specify key on CLI upfront.

              "trrr keyword1 keyword2 keywordN -b"
